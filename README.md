# STLpainter
  ## Status:
    - Stage: firmly in pre-release development
    - Visibility: public.
    - Sponsorship vs Monetization: TBD
  ## Project Objectives
    - Goal 1: soft-launch on miniatures subreddits + ReviewLab
    - Goal 2: hard-launch on {Show HN, Uneed.best, MicroLaunch, Product Hunt, etc}
    - Goal 3: become the open-source 'Hero Forge' alternative
  ## Performance characteristics: 
    - 80% client-side / 20% server-side
    - (base64 = based)

# To-Do
  ## Bugs
    - Temporarily unusable
    - Correctly renders
    - Paint-by-segment is broken
    - Publish full brand color database to public dir
    - Fix interactivity of segment selection
  ## UI/UX:
    - warn users before they close the tab that they need to download their save file or risk losing all progress
    - subtle tooltip(s) about max file limit in the empty state
    - keyboard shortcut listener for switching between segment/paint modes
    - responsiveness across tablet/laptop/desktop
  ## Performance:
    - Look into concurrency / multi-threaded operations on initial model load / purge
    - Maximize but monitor client-side / edge compute & performance

# Misc
  ## Unscheduled
    - commit WIP project setup readme?
    - review React Fiber vs current ThreeJS implementation
    - research options for
